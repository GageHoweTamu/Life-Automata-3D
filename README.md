### Summary

I've been working on this project since March. It's a blocky life simulator inspired by the likes of TheLifeEngine.net, a similar 2-dimensional simulation.

### The Goal

To create a well-performing simulation demonstrating complex behavior that emerges from simple rules.

### Implementation

Rust + Kiss3D graphics library. Will rewrite in C++ with OpenGL next semester.
